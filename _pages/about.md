I am a third year math PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis. My advisor is [Renato Feres](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~feres/).

My current research interests are: dynamical systems, symplectic geometry and stochastic process. More precisely, I am interested in billiard system, related to some applications in mathematical physics.

Here is my [CV](https://gowustl-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/zhang_zhenyi_wustl_edu/EQhpoHTIbwBCu_99NNBJ5jsBotxmm7aS8BR5hMGIHbjFtg?e=M7DsVp).
